  # Clean out the files and variables that gpg-agent uses, and kill the agent.
  # NB Programs that interact with gpg-agent may read GPG_AGENT_INFO to find out
  # the PID of the agent and the socket to use for communication with it.  If
  # this var is out of date, then it can confuse interaction with the agent.
  # This var must be exported so that subprocesses (e.g., rosie) can use the
  # agent.
  unset GPG_AGENT_INFO
  gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
  
  # Restart the agent and wait to ensure it's started before trying to get its
  # PID.
  gpg-agent --daemon --allow-preset-passphrase --batch --max-cache-ttl 43200
  sleep 2

  # Even though gpg-agent removed use of the GPG_AGENT_INFO env variable in
  # v2.20, Rosie is hard-coded to interrogate this variable to find out how to
  # communicate with the agent (see https://github.com/metomi/rose/issues/2483).
  # So, we need to create it manually.
  gpg_sock=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-socket)
